# Breast-cancer-detection-using-logistic-regression
This Python project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for predicting breast cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.  The code implements both Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification models, allowing for comparison of their performance.
